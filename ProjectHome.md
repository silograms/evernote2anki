This very simple app allows you to choose tags from your evernote account which would be turned into an anki file.
This is usefull, if - like me and other - you want to remember in a handy way the notes taken from evernote.

For the moment, the application needs a developper token that you can generate with your evernote login/password here : https://www.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action

Note : If you use the desktop version of evernote, don't forget to sync before using Evernote2Anki.

**Warning** : this token allows access to your evernote account, then you should keep it private .
